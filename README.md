 A text-based video game: players use text commands to explore a textual world.

## Github repo
https://github.com/yetongchen/CS515_project1_Adventure

## time
I spent about 7 hours on the project.

## test 
I tested my code through running the testing commands saved in the test.py file.

## bugs or issues
When setting the win condition, I used the index to refer to a specific room. However, if the map is changed, this win condition might still trigger, causing an error.

## resolved issue
To prevent triggering the winning or losing condition on other maps, I referred to the special room by its specific name throughout the text.

## 3 extensions
### A `help` verb
A `help` verb tells players what the valid verbs are. We write `...` after verbs that expect a target of some kind:
```
> A white room

You are in a simple room with white walls.

Items: shield

Exits: north east

What would you like to do? help
You can run the following commands:
  go...
  look
  get...
  drop...
  inventory
  help
  quit
What would you like to do?
```

### A `drop` verb
The `drop` verb is the opposite of get: take something from your inventory and put it down in the room. Just as get only lets you get items that are in the room, drop should only let you drop items that you already have.
```
> A white room

You are in a simple room with white walls.

Items: shield

Exits: north east

What would you like to do? get shield
You pick up the shield.
What would you like to do? inventory
Inventory:

> A blue room

### Winning and losing conditions
There is a sword and a shield in the rooms as well as a 'boss room' in the map. If you enter the boss room without both the sword and shield, you lose, and the game continues. You can try again to get the weapons. If you enter it with both, you win, and the game ends.
